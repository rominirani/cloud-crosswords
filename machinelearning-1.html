  exolve-across:
    3.	A set of neurons in a neural network that process a set of input features, or the output of those neurons. (5)
    5.	The representation of what a machine learning system has learned from the training data. (5)
    6.	A metric for classification models that answers what proportion of actual positives was identified correctly? (6)
    10.	A node in a neural network, typically taking in multiple input values and generating one output value. (6)
    11.	The fraction of predictions that a classification model got right. (8)
    14.	_____ Analysis: Using statistical or machine learning algorithms to determine a group's overall attitude—positive or negative—toward a service, product, organization, or topic. (9)
    16.	A coefficient for a feature in a linear model, or an edge in a deep network. (6)
    17.	A supervised learning model composed of a set of conditions and leaves organized hierarchically. (8,4)
    18.	______ matrix : A NxN table that aggregates a classification model's correct and incorrect guesses. (9)
    19.	A metric for classification models that answers what proportion of positive identifications was actually correct? (9)
  exolve-down:
    1.	A system (either hardware or software) that takes in one or more input values, runs a function on the weighted sum of the inputs, and computes a single output value. (10)
    2.	In supervised learning, the "answer" or "result" portion of an example. (5)
    3.	A measure of how far a model's predictions are from its label. (4)
    4.	A type of bias that indicates a tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. (12)
    7.	______ system : A system that selects for each user a relatively small set of desirable items from a large corpus. (14)
    8.	A type of model that outputs continuous (typically, floating-point) values. (10)
    9.	A public-domain dataset compiled by LeCun, Cortes, and Burges containing 60,000 images, each image showing how a human manually wrote a particular digit from 0–9. Acronym (5)
    12.	Creating a model that matches the training data so closely that the model fails to make correct predictions on new data. (11)
    13.	In general, any ML system that converts from a raw, sparse, or external representation into a more processed, denser, or more internal representation. (7)
    15.	A collection of models trained independently whose predictions are averaged or aggregated. (8)
